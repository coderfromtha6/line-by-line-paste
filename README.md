# line-by-line-paste
Simple python app to copy a new line from a block of text after each ctrl+v keystroke. For tedious jobs that require copying and pasting individual lines of text.

An exercise in coding improvisation - I needed something so I just made it.

Install requirements with the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Paste your block of text in input.txt and run main.py

Easy!
